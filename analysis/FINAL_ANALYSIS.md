## Key Insights and Implications

### 1. Evolutionary Optimization Superiority
The CMA-ES approach demonstrates that **explicit multi-objective optimization across diverse opponents produces strategically superior results** compared to single-opponent training or imitation learning approaches.

### 2. Complexity vs. Performance Trade-off
**Simpler, well-designed approaches (Evolution) outperform complex deep learning models (Transformer)** in strategic environments, suggesting that strategic games require domain-specific optimization rather than general-purpose sequence modeling.

### 3. Training Environment Importance
**PPO's failure demonstrates the critical importance of diverse opponent training**. Single-opponent training leads to catastrophic overfitting and strategic brittleness.

### 4. Interpretability Matters
**Evolution's transparent parameter structure enables strategic understanding and prediction**, while black-box approaches provide limited insight into strategic reasoning.

## Future Research Directions

### Recommended Improvements

**For Evolution:**
- Extend to more complex strategy spaces
- Multi-population evolutionary approaches
